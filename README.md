## Data Collection and Cleanup

### World Development Indicators Data
1. The data for the World Development Indicators can be found in the World Development Indicators folder.
2. The `EUCountriesDevelopmentIndicators.csv `file is the CSV file downloaded from the World Bank website.
3. The `cleanData.py` is a python script to clean the data. This also contains the code and infromation on how the cleaning was done.
4. The `cleaned_EUCountriesDevelopmentIndicators.csv` file is the cleaned CSV file generated by the `cleanData.py`.

### Fraser Institute
1. The data from the Fraser Institute can be found in the Fraser Institute Raw Data folder
2. The `economicdata2012-2022.csv` file is the raw CSV file downloaded from Fraser Institute for economic factors
3. The `human-freedom-index-2023-datafile.xlsx` file is the raw XLSX file downloaded from Fraser Institute for human freedom factors
4. The `extract_economic_data.py` is a python script to clean the economicdata2012-2022.csv file. This also contains the code and infromation on how the cleaning was done.
5. The `extract_freedom_idx_data.py` is a python script to clean the human-freedom-index-2023-datafile.xlsx. This also contains the code and infromation on how the cleaning was done.
6. The `cleaned_economic_data.csv` is the cleaned CSV file generated by the `extract_economic_data.py`.
7. The `cleaned_freedom_idx_data.py` is the cleaned CSV file generated by the `extract_freedom_idx_data.py`.

### Happiness Index Report.
1. The data for the Happiness Index report can be found in the Happiness Index Raw data folder.
2. The `DataForTable2.1.xls` file is the XLS file downloaded from the Happiness Report website.
3. The `extract_data.py` is a python script to clean the data. This also contains the code and infromation on how the cleaning was done.
4. The `cleaned_happiness_index.csv` file is the cleaned CSV file generated by the `cleanData.py`.

### Combining data and creating features.
1. All processing data after combination and feature creation can be found in the Combining Data and Feature creation folder.
2. The `combine_data.py` is a python script to combine all the cleaned data from the 4 cleaned csv files described above. This also contains the code and infromation on how the cleaning was done.
3. The `combined_dataset.csv` file is the combined CSV file generated by the `combine_data.py` which combines all the cleaned data.
4. The `create_features.py` is a python script to create a JSON file creating features for the model with the same year. This will create a JSON file with an array of objects in the format below. The labels in this case correspond to the year and country the happiness index is for. The features are a list of key value pairs of feature name and value consistent across all features. The features contain information for only the given year.
5. The `feature.json` file is the JSON file generated by the `create_features.py` for features for the same year model.
6. The `create_features_year_back.py` is a python script to create a JSON file creating features for the model with two yeard. This will create a JSON file with an array of objects in the format below. The labels in this case correspond to the year and country the happiness index is for. The features are a list of key value pairs of feature name and value consistent across all features. The features contain information for the given year and the year prior.
7. The `feature_year_back.json` file is the JSON file generated by the `create_features_year_back.py` for features for the one year back model which handles indexes for the same year and the year prior.


JSON format for feature files:
```
[ {
    "labels": {
        "country": {name of country},
        "year": {datapoint year}
    },
    "happiness_index": {happiness index that year}
    "features": {
        "feature_1": {value of feature 1},
        "feature_2": {value of feature 2},
        ...,
    }
}, {...}, ... ]
```

## Data Visualization, Model Evaluation, and Model Training

### Model for one year back
1. In the folder called "Model for one year back", you can find the python script that you can run for:
  - Generating data visualization (3d scatter plot) using dimensionality reduction functions such as PCA, MDS, and t-SNE
  - Model evaluation
  - Model hyperparameter optimization for random forest model and SVR model
  - Model training and determining top 10 features for random forest model and SVR model
